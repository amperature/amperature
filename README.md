# Hi! Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub! I go by many names so I just stick to circaslash for the time being.

I'm a student at the Berklee College of Music pursuing the Electronic Production and Design major along with the Creative Coding minor. You'll see a lot of projects dedicated to that over here. 

In the future, I plan to upload all of my programming projects (games, plugins, scripts, etc.) onto here as circaslash.

Outside of that, I make electronic music as [a.pathrose](https://soundcloud.com/apathrose) and YouTube videos about Tetris as [chronosaga](https://www.youtube.com/chronosaga). I also help with [Cambridge](https://github.com/cambridge-stacker/cambridge), an open source block stacker.

Thanks for reading!
