# Hi! Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub. Legally, I'm श्री but I go by Aero online.

I'm a student at the Berklee College of Music pursuing the Electronic Production and Design major along with the Creative Coding minor. You'll see a lot of projects dedicated to that over here. 

Outside of that, I make electronic music as [a.pathrose](https://soundcloud.com/apathrose) and YouTube videos about Tetris as [chronosaga](https://www.youtube.com/chronosaga). 

Thanks for reading, and if you're an employer, my resume will be here soon. In the meantime, my email is chronosaganet@gmail.com.
